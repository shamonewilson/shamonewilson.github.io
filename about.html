			    		<p> I enjoy math, even though I seem to also be confused when I do math. Its justa fun subject. Ever since I was little, I just thought math was entertainting. The difficulty was something that was definitley there but I just enjoyed that it was hard. Math is what made me start thinking about computors.

			    		<p> After 5th grade, I just began likeing computors. I took a robotics class but I used to feel beehind because I started haveing an objective kinda late. Luckily I learned that I just need to think about myself. </p>

			    		<p> My favorite color is purple, but I like all the colors. Im 15 and my birthday is May 7, 2003. Its funny because my parents have forgotten my birthday twice. Also, I am African American and Mexican. That all folks.
